# Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
# A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
# Note
# You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
